Datediff

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/pokle/datediff.png)](https://travis-ci.org/pokle/datediff)

This is a tool to calculate the difference between two dates in the Gregorian calendar. It is capable of handling leap years.


To build and run my solution, just run ant in this directory. You should see something like to following towards the end:

    [echo] Running against sample1.csv
    [java] 01 01 2011, 02 01 2011, 1
    [java] 13 11 2011, 11 11 2011, 2
    [java] 13 11 2011, 12 11 2011, 1
    [java] 13 11 2011, 13 11 2011, 0
    [java] 13 11 2011, 14 11 2011, 1
    [java] 13 11 2011, 15 11 2011, 2
    [java] 01 01 2000, 01 01 2010, 3652

Cheers!
